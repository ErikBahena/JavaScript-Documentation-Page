Hello to whoever is reading this. This is my fifth project, I'm modeling a documentation page for JavaScript as this is the language I will be learning next. I find this project to be sleek and more modern than not. The main subject this project focuses on is positioning.

This project will demonstrate the following skills:

1.Basic understanding and execution of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2.Creating a repository on GitHub for this site.

3.Creating a folder structure to support the web page.

4.Linking the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files together using link and script tags.

5.Adding the HTML content of: a fixed side-nav-bar for bigger screens, a nar bar on top of the page for smaller screens, basic tags like articles, paragraphs, code, and h1, and horizontle line tags

6.CSS styling such as: a fixed-side nav bar, font families and font sizes. Two media queries which become active when the screen is a certian width; activating a nav-bar that can jump you to different sections of the page. A footer bar with a custom arrow which brings you to the top of the page and as much responsiveness as I could develop throughout the entire page.

7.Staging, commiting and pushing current progress to GitHub.

Although simple, I enjoyed creating this website a lot. It's my first website which inclued two types of navigation bars.

Thank you for reading :)

Hope you enjoy!
